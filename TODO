TODO: Stuff that should be worked into MassText whenever possible
			The items towards the top are the most important

1. Make it actually work!
2. Add a nice GUI, I was thinking using the Shoes framework (at least at first)
3. Store previously used numbers/carriers in a file for quicker retrieval
	- Add a button on the GUI to clear the list in order to update the numbers
		in case the carrier has changed
