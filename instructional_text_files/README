MassText
Version: 2.0

Thank you for downloading MassText
MassText is a program that allows easily sending the same text message
to multiple mobile phones at the same time from a computer.

This is a re-make of my previous MassText program from 
three years ago. The previous time MassText was written in
Python, but this time I am re-writing it using Ruby because
Ruby seems like a nicer, simpler language.

There is not much to see so far, but check back for many 
(hopefully frequent) updates. Feel free to contribute to this project!
To contact me, email erikthiem@gmail.com and please include MassText
in the subject line.

Do NOT push commits to github if they do not function.
