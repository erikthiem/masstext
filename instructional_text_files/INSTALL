How to install MassText:
(you do not actually 'install' it, more like just 'run' it)

1. Download MassText from github.com/erikthiem/masstext
	(you have probably already done this if you are viewing this file)

2. Make sure Ruby is installed

3. Make sure the Ruby gems 'nokogiri' and 'open-uri' are installed. I am pretty
	sure that open-uri comes directly with Ruby, but nokogiri does not. You can
	view instructions on how to install it at nokogiri.org

4. Navigate to the masstext/interfaces/console/ folder

5. Run "ruby console.rb"
