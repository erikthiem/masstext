TODO: Stuff that should be worked into MassText whenever possible
			The items towards the top are the most important

1. Add a nice GUI, I was thinking using the Shoes framework (at least at first)
2. Store previously used numbers/carriers in a file for quicker retrieval
	- Add a button on the GUI to clear the list in order to update the numbers
		in case the carrier has changed
3. Ability to read numbers in a list seperated by commas
4. Ability to read numbers from a list in a text file
5. Add error handling so nasty messages don't appear
