How to install MassText:
(you do not actually 'install' it, more like just 'run' it)

1. Download MassText from github.com/erikthiem/masstext
	(you have probably already done this if you are viewing this file)

2. Make sure Ruby is installed

3. Make sure the Ruby gems 'nokogiri' and 'open-uri' are installed. I am pretty
	sure that open-uri comes directly with Ruby, but nokogiri does not. You can
	view instructions on how to install it at nokogiri.org

4. Navigate to the main directory to which MassText downloaded. It should be called "masstext/"

5. Run "./masstext.sh" in a terminal window. This should start the program in the console interface (the only interface yet to exist).
