MassText
by Erik Thiem

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

MassText sends a text message to multiple phones simultaneously from
a computer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Instructions:

MassText needs the additional Ruby gems:
	nokogiri (tested with version 1.5.6, other versions may work)
	highline (tested with version 1.6.15, other versions may work)

There is no permanent installation, simply run "./masstext.sh" from 
the terminal. If this does not work for whatever reason, try running 
"ruby interfaces/console/console.rb" from the terminal.

possible and will try my best to help you.

Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives, History, etc.:

I know that there are other ways to send mass text messages, but I
wanted to see if I could come up with a way to do so using the terminal
and then to see if I could do the same with a simple GUI application.

I originally started this project in Python about 3 years ago, but I 
abandoned it for the past three years for various reasons. I started
learning Ruby a few weeks ago and am using this to get myself more
acquainted with the language.
