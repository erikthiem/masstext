How to install MassText:

1. Download MassText from github.com/erikthiem/masstext
	(you have probably already done this if you are viewing this file)

2. Make sure Ruby is installed

3. Make sure the Ruby gems 'nokogiri' and 'open-uri' are installed. I am pretty
	sure that open-uri comes directly with Ruby, but nokogiri does not. You can
	view instructions on how to install it at nokogiri.org

4. Navigate to the masstext folder

5. Run "ruby masstext.rb"

6. That's it for now!
