masstext
========

A python program to send out many text messages at once over the internet.

This is being imported from sourceforge because github seems like a much nicer platform
to work with and because I want to start this project up again.
The original address of the project is http://sourceforge.net/projects/masstext/ and I will be
transferring the files as soon as possible.

I'm going to remove the graphical part and only transfer the command-line part, as the graphical
part never ended up working anyways.
