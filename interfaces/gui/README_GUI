MassText should have a nice graphical interface (GUI). This is something
that the previous MassText (using python) never really managed to have, but
I want to do it better this time. I am going to use the Shoes framework 
(shoesrb.com) to start out because it is very simple, and I will only move on
to a more complicated framework if Shoes cannot handle important features
of MassText.

This folder will be used to hold anything GUI related.
